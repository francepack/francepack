## Thanks for stopping by
:wave: Hi, I'm Mason!
### Most recently, I worked at [Needle](https://www.needle.com/) as a contract software developer.
- I implemented redeisgn wireframes for the company's website linked above in wordpress, building upon custom themes, making new pages, learning the intricacies of css in wordpress sites, implementing a responsive design, and closely following wireframes. One accomplishment was custom coding the presentation of employees on the [About Us page](https://www.needle.com/company/about-us)
- I worked on features for a client reporting dashboard, specifically on permissions structures controlling what content is visible, and allowing a superuser to customize what content is viewable. This required tweaking how the data represented who super users are, as well as setting up a permissions structure to control what content was turned on or off. I worked in an angular.js codebase, learning about scope, directives, and data binding.
- I researched how to build custom HTML email templates as a solo project, adhering to industry standards, and formatting in a way that renders effectively across email platforms, testing many different browser views in the process. This template was put into production by a major client.

### Currently...
- I am an instructor for students about to enroll at [Turing School](https://turing.io/), teaching git/github use, basic code/data type syntax, and OOP. We are constantly iterating over curriculum to improve what we teach, and better prepare students for the rigor of Turing.
- I also run escape rooms online for [Paruzal](https://paruzal.com/). Us "GMs" (game masters) typically keep our identities a mystery, but if you are finding out about this in my github readme, you deserve to know. Book a game with GM Mason, why doncha?
- When not in a Pandemic, I sing with several choirs: [Kantorei](https://kantorei.org/) and St. John's Cathedral Choir.

### Project
- I am working on my long term project when I have time- ChefNextDoor. I want to build an application that connects local chefs to one another, allowing people to connect over cuisine. Another inspiration for this project was to try my hand at building a backend with ruby, and continue to practice Vue. Allso, it has been an opportunity to learn about authorization patterns.
