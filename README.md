## Thanks for stopping by
:wave: Hi, I'm Mason!
#### Most recently, I worked at [Needle](https://www.needle.com/) as a contract software developer.
- I implemented redeisgn wireframes for the company's website linked above in wordpress, building upon custom themes, making new pages, learning the intricacies of css in wordpress sites, implementing a responsive design, and closely following wireframes. One accomplishment was creating the presentation of employees on the [About Us page](https://www.needle.com/company/about-us).
- I worked on features for a client reporting dashboard, specifically on permissions structures controlling what content is visible, and allowing a superuser to customize what content is viewable. This required tweaking how the data represented who super users are, as well as setting up a permissions structure to control what content was turned on or off. I worked in an angular.js codebase, learning about scope, directives, and data binding.
- I researched how to build custom HTML email templates as a solo project, adhering to industry standards, and formatting in a way that renders effectively across email platforms, testing many different browser views in the process. This template was put into production by a major client.

#### Work and Activities
- I am an instructor at [Turing School](https://turing.io/), teaching the Mod0 program- incoming students are taught git/github use, basic code/data type syntax, and OOP. We are constantly working to improve curriculum, and best prepare students for the rigor of Turing.
- I run escape rooms online for [Paruzal](https://paruzal.com/).
- I sing with [Kantorei](https://kantorei.org/) and St. John's Cathedral Choir.

#### Projects
- I am making an application to help run my virtual escape rooms. Some of the challenges are thinking about scalability, turning a game script into data, making users log in too protect game data, making user friendly scripts in smalll portions of the screen, responding to different screen sizes, and customization options.
- I work on my long term project when I have time- ChefNextDoor. I want to build an application that connects local chefs to one another, allowing people to connect over cuisine. Another inspiration for this project was to try my hand at building a backend with ruby, and continue to practice Vue. Allso, it has been an opportunity to learn about authorization patterns.
